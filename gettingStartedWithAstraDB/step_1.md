##  What do I get with Astra DB?
DataStax [Astra DB] is built on Apache Cassandra®, the most reliable and scalable database in the world. **Astra DB** removes the pain of implementing and managing your own Apache Cassandra database. In addition of removing that complexity, we’ve also built a whole set of Drivers, APIs, and Integrations that will help you easily connect to your application.

### Under the hood
Creating a database within Astra provides you with a **[serverless]** database cluster built on Apache Cassandra® that starts with 3 nodes using a replication factor of 3.

By **"[serverless]"** we mean that **Astra** databases are elastic and can scale to meet your demands. **Astra** also separates storage and compute to keep TCO (Total Cost of Ownership) down. No need to pay for processing time if your application is in-between operations.

**Astra** currently supports deployment to all three major cloud providers (**GCP, AWS, Azure**) and provides a wide range of geographic [regions] for use around the world. You can also deploy to multiple regions within a single database. Click a button, pick a region, **Astra** handles deploying a new datacenter and replicates data for you.

Finally, **Astra** provides a whole set of tools and [APIs (REST, GraphQL, Document, gRPC)] to make it easy to hook up your application. Take a look at this [FAQ] to learn more.
