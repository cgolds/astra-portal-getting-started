# Create your first database ðŸ”¥
DataStax Astra DB is built on Apache Cassandra, the most reliable and scalable database on the freaking planet. Astra removes the pain of managing your own database and does it all for you. Just click a button, create a database, and grow your application without bounds. We have your back.

Let's start by creating an Astra database. Click the link/button/whatever below and follow the prompts to get started.

You'll be presented with four options

### 1. **Database name** 
The name you assign to your database. This is the name displayed within the Astra console.

### 2. **Keyspace name** 
Where all of your database tables are stored within the **database**. 

_If you're already an Apache CassandraÂ® user this is exactly the same as the keyspaces you are accustomed to and use a replication factor of 3._

### 3. Cloud deployment **Provider** 
A list of the available cloud providers. Currently, Astra offers deployment to all three major providers **Google Cloud**, **Amazon Web Services**, and **Microsoft Azure**. 

_Free tier users are limited to selections with Google Cloud._

### 4. Cloud deployment **region** 
The geographic region within the chosen cloud provider. Just pick one close to you for now.

_No cloud provider accounts are needed for any of the options presented. Astra handles all cloud provider deployments and details._
