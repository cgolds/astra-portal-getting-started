Understand Astra DB and how it differs from its underlying technology, Apache Cassandra®.

You can use the Astra DB console and [APIs (REST, GraphQL, Document, gRPC)] to greatly simplify cloud-native Cassandra application development. Astra DB reduces deployment time from weeks to minutes, and delivers a combination of serverless, pay-as-you-go pricing with the freedom and agility of multi-cloud and open-source software. All that functionality is yours without the hassles of complex database and infrastructure administration.
