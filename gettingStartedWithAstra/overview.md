# Getting Started with Astra DB
Understand Astra and how it differs from open source Apache Cassandra. DataStax Astra DB is a serverless, multi-cloud native DBaaS built on Apache Cassandra®.

You can use the Astra DB console and [APIs (REST, GraphQL, Document, gRPC)](https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra-serverless/docs/develop/developing.html) to greatly simplify cloud-native Cassandra application development. Astra DB reduces deployment time from weeks to minutes, and delivers a combination of serverless, pay-as-you-go pricing with the freedom and agility of multi-cloud and open-source software. All that functionality is yours without the hassles of complex database and infrastructure administration.
