> ⚠️ Difficulty: **`Beginner`, we don't expect you to know how to use Astra Streaming and Apache Pulsar.**


**Astra Streaming**, powered by the open source project **Apache Pulsar**, is a hosted pay-as-you-go cloud-native, distributed messaging and streaming platform. Pulsar has a concept of **Tenants** which is the top level administrative unit. A tenant has multiple namespaces for logical grouping of different applications. In each namespace you can create multiple topics to send and receive data. Your Astra Streaming account allows you to create multiple Pulsar tenants, namespaces and topics.

## Steps to get started

### Create a topic
Create a partitioned or non-persistent [topics] in the default namespace for starters.
